# AIProject
This project was done for the AI course (EEE472: Artificial Intelligence) There was a machine learning-based project and also a deep learning-based project. Both the projects are quite trivial. For the machine learning part, a heart disease prediction model was developed using popular machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN. For the deep learning model, an image segmentation model was developed. This model can be found in the TensorFlow image segmentation example.
